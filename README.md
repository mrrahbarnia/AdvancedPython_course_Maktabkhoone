 I'm gonna use some methods in ML,Webscraping and Mysql to predict Fairprice of cars   
 **Step1:** 
 first of all we gotta install all modules we need and send them into requirements.txt   
 **step2:**
 in this project i'm gonna use Truecar.com to obtain all required data.
 in this project i only need four parameters(model,year,miles,price).
 send get request for the range that i want and scrap all data with bs4 and put them into my database with mysql.connector   
 **step3:**
 at the end we have to fit all data in x,y parameters to predict the fair price with DecisionTreeClassifier
